# books-vue-demo
Demo project for Spring Boot and Vue.js 

(Thymeleaf, Bootstrap, DataTables, axios, Vuelidate are also used)

## how to run
This is a Maven project. You can run it by clean install.

Check the app:

http://localhost:8080/

REST API calls:

http://localhost:8080/api/

## details
I made this project to try out Vue.js and check the capabilities. I did not want to use Node.js, so I guess Vue.js was a great choice. (This case I could not use Single File Components)
It was not the easiest thing to make it all run perfectly in IE11, but I had to, so this is why I could not use ES6.
